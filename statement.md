# Project Statement – Snake–Water–Gun Game

## 📝 Problem Statement
In many real-world systems, choices interact in non-linear ways—each option may be strong against one but weak against another. This project simulates such competitive decision-making using the classic Snake–Water–Gun game, where a user competes against a computer using predefined logical rules.

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
- Create an interactive Python game  
- Implement real-life-inspired decision logic  
- Allow user input and computer-generated responses  
- Provide win/lose/draw outcomes  
- Act as a beginner-friendly demonstration of Python programming concepts  

## 👥 Target Users
- Students learning Python  
- Beginners exploring game logic  
- Users who enjoy simple console-based games  
- Teachers needing examples of conditional logic and randomness  

## 📌 High-Level Features
- Console-based user interaction  
- Random computer choice generator  
- Real-life analogy-based decision rules  
- Easy to run and understand  
- No external dependencies (only Python)
