# Snake-water-gun-game
A simple Snake Water Gun game where the player competes against the computer. Each choice wins, loses, or draws based on real-life logic: Snake beats Water, Water beats Gun, and Gun beats Snake. It models competitive decision systems similar to strategy, biology, and real world interactions.
# Snake–Water–Gun Game (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple Python-based Snake–Water–Gun game where the player competes against the computer. The logic is inspired by real-life decision systems where every choice is strong against one option, weak against another, and neutral sometimes. It demonstrates interactive programming, control flow, and basic AI randomness.
